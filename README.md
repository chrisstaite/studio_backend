# Studio Backend

## Overview

This project is part of the radio studio project.  It has the goal of producing an open source and useable radio studio.  The feature set should include by the end:

- Multiple live input sources
  - From the device
  - From live streams
- Multiple recorded input sources
  - From a library
  - From YouTube
  - From Bandcamp
- Multiple live output sources
  - To devices
  - To live streams
  - A rolling recording file
- Individual mapping and mixing between the inputs and outputs
- Psuedo-devices for multi-channel output devices to allow, for example, 8 stereo streams to play back to a 16-channel output 

## Getting started

You can set up an environment to run the software by installing Python 3.  For NPM to work, you will also need Python 2 installed unfortunately - this is for dependencies to build only, not for runtime.

On Mac OS X if running Python 3.6 (seems to be fixed in 3.7) you will also need to run the following:
`/Applications/Python\ 3.6/Install\ Certificates.command`

Then you can setup using

### Linux/OS X

```sh
python3 -m virtualenv venv
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | venv/bin/python3
venv/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
venv/bin/python3 -m nodeenv -p
```

Finally run with:

```sh
venv/bin/python3 server.py
```

Then open the UI at <http://localhost:5000>

### Windows

```cmd
python3 -m virtualenv venv
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py > get-pip.py
venv/bin/python3.exe get-pip.py
venv/Scripts/pip3.exe install -r requirements.txt
venv/Scripts/python3.exe -m nodeenv -p
```

Finally run with:

```cmd
venv\Scripts\python3.exe server.py
```

Then open the UI at <http://localhost:5000>

## Current State

Features that are missing are as follows:

- Downloading playlist items from external sources (e.g. YouTube/Bandcamp)
- A nice UI that isn't all on one page and the same for all users
- A live playlist with timings and pause points for live (see audio.playlist)
- A soundboard or jingles etc
